# Knight's Tour Efficiency
For my project (in Computer Science), I decided to tackle the knight’s tour problem. A knight’s tour is a series of moves where a knight visits every square on a n x n chessboard (only once). If the knight manages to stop/finish one move away from the starting position, the tour is called closed. If it finishes anywhere else, the tour is called open. This is a common computer science problem where students must create a program to solve/find a sequence of tours, these programs will be the focus of my project .<br/>

A relevant notion to the knight’s tour problem is Hamilton Paths and Circuits, which is a part of Graph Theory. A Hamilton path is a simple path in a graph G that passes through every vertex exactly once .A simple circuit in a graph G that passes through every vertex exactly once is called a Hamilton circuit .This relates to the knight’s tour problem since a closed tour corresponds to a Hamilton circuit  and the problem is similar to the Hamilton cycle problem .<br/> 

I will be comparing a brute force method that relies on recursion and backtracking to the Warnsdorff method (named after the German mathematician) which is a heuristic method that finds ‘successor’ squares. I will compare the time for them to solve a n x n chessboard (do multiple runs with the size of the chessboard growing every run until the brute force method takes way too long to compute, since this method is known to be slower as the board becomes bigger).So the efficiency of both programs/algorithms is my research question, as I will be determining how both fare in terms of computing speed (comparing times to see how much better is one method to the other, when sticking to smaller boards and without being specific about what kind of tour it gives back).<br/>
